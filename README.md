# first-project
First project at Yandex-Web-Dev+ training course
Name: How-to-learn
Technologies: html, css, flex-box, transformation and animation of elements, hover effects.
This is a simple LP(landing page), designed to demonstrate my skills in flex-layout and animation of some elements, and the first project i wrote, actualy.
p.s. In the initial brief, there was no favicon and no paths for links were specified, so something most suitable was found and selected instead of stubs.
