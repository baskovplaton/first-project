# first-project
First project at Yandex-Web-Dev+ training course
Name: How-to-learn
This is a simple LP(landing page), designed to demonstrate my skills in flex-layout and animation of some elements, and the first project i wrote, actualy.
Technologies: html, css, flex-box, transformation and animation of elements, hover effects.
p.s. In the initial brief, there was no favicon and no paths for links were specified, so something most suitable was found and selected instead of stubs.
